https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g4NPayMnNV8UUNdoTLZdcf4BehCip14QDuRwa4V7uFU/edit?usp=sharing
- This involves one project, in the folder called wednes_thursday_09_10:

-- JavaScriptArray

-- JavaScript-Day-1

All the tasks were implemented, besides for the Red tasks on JavaScript-Day-1, as they were not required, and I was running short on time, because there were a lot of material overall :-)


## Thursday:
For Tuesday, the following tasks are implemented:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vctwfldnReoszybFU0jO7Jm7JQ4Ia-CJvEymaj-QClM/edit?usp=sharing
- This involves one projects, in the folder called wednes_thursday_09_10:

-- DomManipulation

In here, I have added a HTML page, including JS and CSS, for each of the tasks on that document. 

All of the tasks are done, besides from the red ones, (due to lack of time). 

They can get seen here:
- https://www.work.emucoach.com

The tasks from "Getting Started with the fetch-API" (separate docs) were skipped for now, because they weren't mandatory, and I was short on time, and limited knowledge.

All the solutions can be found on the Github Repository. They are however all in one initial commit though, which can be seen here:

https://github.com/VeraUtil/SP3-Week3/commit/c10b998ab23125374bad5f5aec5eaf75fdb1c60f
